# Porto Ghost theme Development

This is a trial clone of the Porto Ghost Theme.
For learning purposes only.

**Goals**:

- Make Navbar fully responsive
- Make the Theme Toggle functional
- Add a Hero Section

There is essentially no CSS - the only CSS rules definted are those necessary
to pass gscan - and those rules don't do anything.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJS (v18.12.x)
- git
